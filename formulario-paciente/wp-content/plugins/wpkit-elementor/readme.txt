<strong>Flexiable Panel Module</strong>
<p>We redesign the Elementor editor panel UI in order to expend the viewport and make the panel more flexible, not only the dark visual style but also you can drag and drop the panel to anywhere on the editing screen.</p>

<strong>Global Block Module</strong>
<p>Global Block is an important built-in module. You can create the global block with Elementor and use it as the global template part such as header, footer, sidebar or anywhere.</p>
